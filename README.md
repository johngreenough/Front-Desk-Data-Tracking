# Front-Desk-Data-Tracking
### This tool is used to collect important data, and then process the given data into visual tools that allow a user to understand the relationships between the visitors to the office, what program they are in, what course they need help with, and what time they are visiting. This allows the office to make decisions in hiring for next term, working hours, etc... This tool is automated to provide monthly data using VBS code.
